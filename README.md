///Game idea/purpose:///
This is a puzzle-based game inspired by DDR.
The idea is to to teach or introduce code to the player.
To win the game, the player must complete each line of code.



////BUT THERE'S A CATCH!////
The player will play against a timer. (maybe 20 minutes)
If the player proceeds to the next round, 
the player starts the next stage with the 
leftover time from the previous round.
